Ever got annoyed of constantly going through hard to remember steps to get your Discord token, for whatever it is? Well that's why I made these two scripts to simply do everything for you.

# Help & Support
Simply ask on the issues page and I'll assist you as quick as I can

# Discord Client (DESKTOP)
Click `CTRL+SHIFT+I` and click on the console tab, once you've done that paste the code below. (All open source in the other files for you to view)
```
OK
```

# Discord Browser (CHROME/BRAVE/OTHER)
Click `CTRL+SHIFT+J` to go directly to the console tab, once you're in that tab paste the code below. 
```
OK
```

Enjoy people <3
